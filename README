These modules do intelligent things with nested perl data structures.
The transformation engine is a general simple transformation engine
and can run in a selective mode or a constructive mode.  In the
selective mode, it behaves like a database query engine.  In the
constructive mode it constructs a result based on the structure of the
original data.  Transformations can be cascaded.  The merger also
deals with general nested perl data structures.  The Comparator
generates structured differences that mirror the structure of the
compared data structures.

If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to create the readme file.

You can create it now by using the command shown above from this directory.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
